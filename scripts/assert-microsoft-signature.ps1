.SYNOPSIS
  Refuse to run a native executable Windows cannot prove Microsoft signed.

.DESCRIPTION
  `msedgedriver.exe` is downloaded over the network and then executed with the
  developer's privileges by the setup script and again by the E2E runner. Both
  the trust chain and the publisher are checked: a validly signed binary from
  someone else is still not the driver. The organisation is matched rather than
  a leaf thumbprint because Microsoft's signing certificates rotate.

  Throws on any failure; callers invoke it with `&` and let the error propagate.

.PARAMETER Path
  The executable to verify.
